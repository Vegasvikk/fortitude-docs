# Fortitude
--------------------
Fortitude is designed for building products, not prototypes.

## Fortitude provides powerful HTML
## constructs to write your CSS for you
------------------------------------
Fortitude is designed around one
simple principle: **Keep developers out of
the CSS and provide them with a
consistent API to compose views, all in
HTML.**

## Vertical Rhythm
-------------------
Good [vertical rhythm](http://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm/) guides the user's
gaze comfortably through the content
by ensuring consistent, predictable
vertical spacing between all elements.

Everything in Fortitude uses vertical rhythm,
which allows you to compose in
perfect vertical spacing.

## BEM Naming Conventions
-------------------------
BEM syntax keeps you out of the documentation
and in the HTML. Fortitude follows
consistent conventions. Be amazed
at how often you guess right at the name of the tool
you need. For more, check out this article
"[MindBEMding – Getting Your Head ’Round BEM Syntax](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax)" by Harry Roberts.

## Don’t Fight the Cascade
---------------------------
Fortitude CSS classes apply the styles you
want without incomprehensible trees of inheritance.
When you need new functionality,
extending Fortitude is a breeze.

If you follow the [Fortitude conventions](http://fortitude.io/#/architecture),
you won't waste time playing "wack-a-mole" in CSS.

## Build However You Desire
---------------------------
Unlike **some** frameworks, Fortitude doesn't get in
your way. You think in visual styles instead
of abstract component names, and we
don't dump an entire visual codebase into
your project. It's up to you to establish a
visual theme with a designer or a tool like
[Adobe Kuler](https://kuler.adobe.com/create/color-wheel).

## For CSS Wizards only
------------------------
Just kidding, everyone can use Fortitude with ease!
