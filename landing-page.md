# Why use Fortitude?
--------------------
Designed for products, not prototypes.

And it’s Better Than Bootstrap™.

## See all the things, all the time.
------------------------------------
Fortitude is architected around one
simple principle: keep developers out of
the css and provide them with a
consistent API to compose views, all in
markup.

Semantic zealots: **you're wrong.**

## Vertical Rhythm.
-------------------
Good vertical rhythm guides the user's
gaze comfortably through your content
by ensuring consistent, predictable
vertical spacing between all elements.
Everything in Fortitude respects a base
vertical unit of size, Doing The Math For
You™.

## BEM Naming Conventions
-------------------------
block__element--modifier syntax keeps
you out of the documentation and in the
markup. Fortitude classes follow
consistent conventions. You'll be amazed
at how often you 'guess right' at the class
you need. For more, check out this article
MindBEMding – getting your head ’round
BEM syntax by Harry Roberts.

## Don’t fight the cascade.
---------------------------
Fortitude classes apply the styles you
want without a ridiculous
incomprehensible tree of 'inheritance'.
When you need new functionality,
extending Fortitude is a breeze, and you
won't spend time playing wack-a-mole in
your CSS if you follow the fortitude
conventions outlined here.

## Build however you want.
--------------------------
Unlike `<mocking>`soooome`</mocking>`
frameworks, Fortitude doesn't get in
your way. You think in visual styles instead
of abstract component names, and we
don't dump an entire visual codebase into
your project. It's up to you to establish a
visual theme with a designer or a tool like
Adobe Kuler..

## For CSS Wizards only.
------------------------
Lol, jk, everyone can totes use it.
