fortitude-docs [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fortitude/fortitude-docs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fortitude/fortitude-docs)
==============

Read The Docs or visit at [http://fortitude.io](http://fortitude.io)!

Currently it's pretty bare here. But feel free to look at our [styleguide](http://hired.com/library) in production.


Dependencies
------------

Use NPM to install the local dependancies if you want to run the docs site locally:

```sh
$ cd fortitude-sass
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

Run the site with grunt. IT will automatically bind to port 9000 and a new default browser window will open with the address.

```sh
$ grunt serve
```
